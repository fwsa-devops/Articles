Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. CSS is used to define the presentation of a document, including the fonts, colors, layout, and other aspects of the document's content. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, as well as provide a framework for describing content on the Web. CSS describes how HTML elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
