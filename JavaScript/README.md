JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. JavaScript is both an object-oriented and a functional programming language. It was first implemented in 1995 by Netscape as a part of the browser's Active Scripting engine. 

JavaScript has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification. The latest version of the language is called ECMAScript 2015. JavaScript is used in many websites and is the language of the World Wide Web. JavaScript is also used in many other applications, including desktop publishing, web browsing, and video games.
