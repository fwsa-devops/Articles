# What is Rails?

Rails is a web application development framework written in the Ruby programming language. It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs to get started. It allows you to write less code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks. Experienced Rails developers also report that it makes web application development more fun.

The Rails Philosophy includes two major guiding principles:

- Don't Repeat Yourself: **DRY** is a principle of software development which states that "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system". By not writing the same information over and over again, our code is more maintainable, more extensible, and less buggy.

- Convention over Configuration: **COCO** is a principle of software development which states that "Configuration should be done with care and deliberation, but it should not be done by any one person in charge of configuration. It should be done by a team of people who agree on the configuration". By using a convention over configuration, we can make our code more readable and maintainable.
