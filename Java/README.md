Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.  It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. 

As of 2016, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 8 million developers. Java is a concurrent, concurrent-object-oriented language. It has classes, methods, fields, variables, and a simple but powerful expression language. Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
